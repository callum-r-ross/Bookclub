        <h4>BEng Electronic and Electrical Engineering (2:1) – Robert Gordon University (2016-2020)
        </h4>
        <p>During my studies, I covered a wide range of computer and software engineering, including modules in introduction to 
            computer engineering, microprocessors and microcontrollers and computer architecture. I have a solid understanding 
            of low-level software development with experience in coding in C, C++ and assemble language on the Motorola 68HC11. 

            My honors year project involved the design and implementation of an ultrasonic collision detection system.
             Using two Arduino microcontrollers coded in C++ I developed a system which could detect and display
              the distance of a nearby object.
